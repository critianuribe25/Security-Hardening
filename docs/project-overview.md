# Windows Security Hardening — Project Overview

This project focuses on applying basic security hardening steps to a Windows machine using built-in tools and settings.

## Key Objectives
- Review overall security posture using Windows Security
- Verify and enable firewall protection
- Check antivirus and threat protection status
- Confirm User Account Control (UAC) is configured appropriately
- Ensure Windows Updates are current
- Review user accounts and access levels

## Why This Matters
Endpoint security is a critical part of IT and cloud environments.  
Even the most secure cloud infrastructure can be at risk if end-user devices are not configured securely.
